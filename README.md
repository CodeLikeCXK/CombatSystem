- Move the right joystick of your gamepad or the mouse left and right to switch between enemies when one is locked. 
- If you are running and attack without releasing the run button you will perform a rolling slash.
- If you attack just before stop rolling you will also perform a rolling slash.
- Block and press the attack button when the enemy starts performing an attack to parry it. Attacking him after being parried will kill him instantly.
